# No Ceilings Data Examples: Maternal Mortality

Within this directory you will find a very basic p5.js sketch using the maternal mortality indicator as an example of using this data resource.

##index.html and embed.html
The index.html page contains a sketch based on our original maternal mortality story for noceilings.org, that charts the regional data for maternal mortality over time, and displays the actual yearly values as well as the percent change between 1995 and 2010. The javascript file for this sketch is located at js/sketch.js.

The embed.html page exists as a way to embed this sketch into your own site.

To embed this sketch into your own website, use the code below:

```
<iframe style="border: none; width: 600px; height: 600px;" src="http://orglennon.github.io/noceilings-data/examples/maternal-mortality/embed.html"></iframe>
```

This is only the very beginning of what one can do with this data, and we encourage you to play around with this sketch or sketches of your own to explore the full data set.
